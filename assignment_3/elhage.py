To Concatenate Two Doubly Linked Lists:

You have two Doubly Linked Lists, List 1 and List 2, and you will add List 2 to List 1.

First, you will find the node that List 2's Head points to (let's call this node H2)
Next, you will find the node that List 1's tail references (T1), and link the node to H2
Now that we have linked the tail Node of List 1 to the Head Node of List 2, we must update List 1's Tail reference. We will do this by setting it equal to the node that List 2's tail reference points to.

'String'
To recursively check if a string is a palindrome, you will first start with a string.

You will compare the first letter of the string, to the last letter of the string. If they are the same, then we recursively call the same function on the same string, only we splice it so that the string is one character shorter from each side. If the two characters are not the same, the function should return False.

The recursive function will have an if statement and return true if the String length is less than 1 (meaning that it has checked the entire string)



The situation in which a hash table is not full yet can not have a new element inserted is essentially one where the hashing function does not 

suppose we have an array of 10 elements
