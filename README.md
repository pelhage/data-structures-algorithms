This is the coursework I did for a data structures and algorithms course at the University of Western Ontario. The language used in class was Python. All code in the answer files was written by me.


## Course description

The purpose of this course is to provide students with foundations in the basic concepts of data structures and algorithms. The main objective of the course is to teach the students how to select and design data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for problems that they might encounter. Students will be exposed to a variety of data structures, their advantages and disadvantages, and will learn when different data structures are useful. This course is also about ensuring that students understand basic algorithms for manipulating these data structures and using them in varying informatics and analytics domains.

Topics covered in this course include:
* Stacks and queues
* Lists
* Recursion
* Analysis of Algorithms
* Trees, binary search trees, multi-way search trees
* Dictionaries, hash tables
* Graphs, graph traversals, graph algorithms
* Sorting and searching
